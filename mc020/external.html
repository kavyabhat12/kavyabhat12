    <h1> Temple</h1>
    <p>A temple (from the Latin templum) is a building reserved for spiritual rituals
         and activities such as prayer and sacrifice. Religions which erect temples 
         include Christianity (whose temples are typically called churches), Hinduism 
         (called mandira) Confucianism (which are sometimes called the Temple of 
         Confucius), and ancient religions such as the Ancient Egyptian religion 
         and the Ancient Greek religion.</p>
